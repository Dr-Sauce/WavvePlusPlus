# Q&A:

**○ What's the difference between **Wavve++** and **Wavve++ Lite**?**

Wavve++ has a feature that detects whether you've used it before so you can easily install Scriptable. Wavve++ Lite doesn't have this feature.

**○ Why doesn't Wavve++ doesn't support iOS 14 or lower?**

As said Wavve++ detects whether you've used Wavve++ before. The code used on this part does not work on iOS 14 or lower.

For iOS 14 (or lower) you can use Wavve++ Lite. Just keep in mind you'll have to manually install Scriptable.

**○ What is the **Wavve++.txt**(or firstrun.txt) file in Files app?**

That's the file used to detect whether you've installed Wavve++ before. If you delete that file Wavve++ will think you've never used Wavve++ before and prompt the setup popup again. (So don't delete it.)

If you really hate that file staying in your Files app, you can use Wavve++ Lite.

**○ Certain streaming links not playing.**

Scriptable code doesn't support all streaming links. Use [Wavve++ 1.2](https://github.com/Dr-Sauce/WavvePlusPlus/releases/tag/1.2) to play unsupported links.

# Known issues

- SBS buffers a lot while playing. (Currently cannot be fixed.)

- JTBC, Channel A has low quality. (Use [Wavve++ 1.2](https://github.com/Dr-Sauce/WavvePlusPlus/releases/tag/1.2))
