# Q&A

**○ What's the difference between **Wavve++** and **Wavve++ Lite**?**

Wavve++ has a feature that detects whether you've used Wavve++ before so you can easily install VLC. Wavve++ Lite doesn't have this feature.

**○ Why can't I use Wavve++ on iOS 14 or lower? (Why can I only use Wavve++ Lite on iOS 14 or lower?)**

As said Wavve++ detects whether you've used Wavve++ before. The code used on this part does not work on iOS 14 or lower.

(So that's why you need to manually install VLC if you use Wavve++ Lite.)

**○ What is the **firstrun.txt** file in Files app?**

That's the file used to detect whether you've used Wavve++ before. If you delete that file Wavve++ will think it's your first time and prompt the setup popup again. (So don't delete it.)

If you really hate that file staying in your Files app, you can use **Wavve++ Lite**.
